🎬 Netflix User Subscription Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the subscription type (Basic, Standard, or Premium) of Netflix users based on their demographic and usage data.

📌 Project Overview

Streaming platforms like Netflix collect massive amounts of user data, such as:

Age, gender, country

Device usage (mobile, TV, laptop, etc.)

monthly revenue

plan duration and device

By analyzing this data, we can predict which subscription plan (Basic, Standard, Premium) a user is likely to choose. This can help Netflix (or similar platforms) in:

Customer segmentation

Targeted marketing campaigns

Personalized recommendations

Business decision-making

🚀 Features

Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Machine Learning models for classification

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)

Deployment-ready structure using Flask/FastAPI (optional extension)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization

scikit-learn → Machine learning models

jupyter notebook → Interactive development

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Netflix-Subscription-Prediction.git
cd Netflix-Subscription-Prediction


Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

📊 Workflow

Load Dataset → Netflix user dataset (CSV/Excel).

Data Preprocessing → Handle missing values, categorical encoding, normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis → Visualize patterns, correlations.

Model Training → Train classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluation → Compare models using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

Prediction → Predict subscription type for new/unseen users.

(Optional) Deploy with Flask/FastAPI as a simple web app.

📈 Example Results

Achieved ~85% accuracy with Random Forest.

Subscription prediction distribution visualized with confusion matrix.

Business insights: Younger users prefer Basic, long-term users prefer Premium.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Integrate deep learning models for better accuracy.

Use real-time streaming data.

Add dashboard for visualization & prediction (Streamlit/PowerBI).

Deploy on cloud (Heroku/AWS).
